#Description of the problem
Create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.

#how you solved it
 Created layout with:
  Train Name
  Destination 
  First Train Time -- in military time
  Frequency -- in minutes
  Coded this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
 Worked on capturing the data and showing it on top of the train information

#technical approach
Layout with: HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
Capured the data using JQuery
Save the data using Firebase so users from many different machines must be able to view same train times
