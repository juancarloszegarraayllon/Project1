#Project 1
#Description of the problem
Create a useful web application. Useful information for atteding music events is dispersed on differentÂ websites.
Put different resources on one page because besides checking what music events are happening, people might also be interested 
in visiting a restaurant nearby or check the local news to be informed, all of this can be done without having to use different 
apps or websites.

#How you solved it
 The application helps music lovers to find local music events happening in a span of 24 hours. By clicking on the events they can purchase tickets
 through Eventbrite. Users can also check what events are happening in any city around the world and allows them to save their favorite city
 for future reference. The website also displays
 nearby restaurants and local news.
